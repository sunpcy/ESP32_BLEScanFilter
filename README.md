# ESP32_BLEScanFilter
This repository contains code for a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) server implemented on ESP32 devices. The server initializes a BLE service and characteristic, enabling data exchange with connected clients. It utilizes unique UUIDs for identification and supports reading and writing operations via BLE characteristics. The code includes BLE advertising to promote server visibility, facilitating device discovery. Key aspects include RSSI measurement for signal strength estimation, moving average algorithms for stability in RSSI readings, and Least Squares Method for position estimation based on RSSI values, enhancing accuracy in location tracking applications.
